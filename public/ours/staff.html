                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">I am a rising senior pursuing a dual degree in mathematics and biochemistry. I started my first independent research experience my sophomore year, the lab focused on how the amyloid fibers of B2M protein were formed,
                                        which is related to diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. We used an agent called Thioflavin T( ThT) which becomes strongly fluorescent when binding to amyloid fibers. My focus was using this fluorescent technique
                                        to identify which catalysts helps the most in allowing ThT to bind to the protein. I learned how to utilize fluorescent spectroscopy and advanced microscopy in this research experience. This year I will be doing
                                        research in the mathematical field regarding math modeling and data science.</p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">I first contacted OURS my freshman year to ask about research in the biochemistry field. OURS helped me narrow down faculty and program research, taught me how to reach out to faculty, upgrade my application materials
                                        and practice my interview skills. Overall, doing independent study and research give me first-hand experience, practice with skills and most importantly opened my eyes to new technology and development. I truly
                                        think OURS can help any majors in finding research and programs!</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">I am a junior member of the Commonwealth Honors College studying computer science with a minor in linguistics. When I came to UMass freshman year, I knew I had a strong interest in doing research to complement my education
                                        here and to prepare for my career and the possibility of graduate school. With guidance from the OURS office, I was able to find many opportunities I would not have found on my own. Previously, I have completed
                                        internships at MIT Lincoln Lab and the MITRE Corporation. Currently, I am working on my honors thesis on natural language processing (NLP) with Professor Mohit Iyyer on campus. I am interested in how to improve
                                        computer understanding of natural language and how they can better answer questions. I see research as a way to tackle problems that I am passionate about solving, and also a great way to apply what I learn in class.
                                        There are many opportunities on and off campus that many students do not know are there, and finding them can be an extremely daunting process. I would love to help students in any field seek out the positions that
                                        are the best fit for them that they are excited about. Taking advantage of the OURS office is a fantastic way to take the first step in conducting research!</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">I’m a sophomore who is double majoring Biochemistry and Food Science. I am also a member of the Commonwealth Honors College and am on the pre-med track. First semester sophomore year is when I got involved in research
                                        and joined Dr. Hang Xiao’s lab in the Food Science Department. In my lab, we extract phenols out of different foods which are then tested for toxicity in human colon carcinoma cells. The goal of this research is
                                        to develop nutraceuticals that will prevent and reduce the size of cancer tumors. Working in a research lab allows me to practice and apply the skills I learn in class and to make useful connections to the lecture
                                        material. As a freshman, I knew I wanted take part in research, but I felt overwhelmed with the task finding a lab to join. I’m here to tell you that starting your research journey really isn’t as hard as it seems!
                                        I’m so excited to be able to work for OURS and to be able to help everyone find the opportunity to participate in research that is meaningful to them.</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">I am a senior Public Health major on the pre-med track with minors in Psychology and English. When I first came to UMass, I knew I wanted to get involved in research as soon as possible and immediately sought out the
                                        OURS office. With their guidance, I was able to join the Moorman lab in the Psychology department my first semester freshman year, where we study the neurobiology of motivation and reward in addiction. I became
                                        involved in multiple projects that study how orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus contribute to drug-seeking behavior, learning techniques such as immunostaining, optogenetic imaging, and how to conduct behavioral
                                        testing in rat models. These skills led me to obtain a research assistant position at Harvard Medical School’s Division of Sleep Medicine, where I investigated the role of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons
                                        in the regulation of REM sleep over the last two summers. Back at UMass, I will be continuing my research in the Moorman lab with an independent project that examines the role of orexin in reward-seeking behaviors
                                        for saccharin, a common artificial sweetener. Both of these invaluable experiences have solidified my passion for research and would not have been possible without the help of OURS. I look forward to working with
                                        students to find research opportunities both on- and off-campus so they may discover passions of their own and take advantage of all that research has to offer!<br></p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">Hi! I’m a senior member of the Commonwealth Honors College majoring in Math and on the pre-med track. I first got involved in research at UMass my sophomore year when I joined Professor Kyle Cave’s Visual Cognition
                                        and Attention Lab in the Psychology &amp; Brain Sciences Department. This year, I will be doing my honors thesis, using EEG experiments to discover how neural contralateral delay activity can reflect working memory
                                        capacity. The conclusions from this experiment will help us better understand the way people process visual cues to execute search tasks. Through my research experiences, I have not only gained content knowledge
                                        ranging from programming to ethics training, but also a variety of skills I can apply to future research positions and professions overall. I am more confident in my ability to lead a project, excited to present
                                        my ideas to a group to gain new perspectives, and constantly curious as to what the next innovative step could be.<br></p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">When I first came to UMass, I knew I wanted to get involved in research, but wasn’t sure where to get started. The thought of delving into a lab, and then thesis, was definitely daunting, but I had a lot of help along
                                        the way. Visiting OURS made everything seem a little bit easier and more manageable. I would love to share my experiences with other students, help answer their questions, and assist in figuring out how research
                                        opportunities at UMass can fit with their long term goals.<br></p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">I am a sophomore Animal Science major on the Pre-Veterinary track. I first became involved in research my freshman year when I joined the Suvorov Lab in the Environmental Health Sciences department. Coming to UMass,
                                        one of my goals was to join a lab to learn more about the different aspects of research, such as writing papers and performing tests. Once I began contributing to the research projects, it sparked so much joy and
                                        interest for me and helped solidify my career goals. My lab currently works on multiple projects, one of which focuses on the mTOR pathway and how it affects the liver lipid metabolism; the second project is investigating
                                        the issue of transgenerational chemical exposures and its effect on behavior. My senior thesis will ideally continue this research.<br></p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 13px;margin-bottom: 5px;">This past semester I worked with the OURS program to find a summer internship in an area similar to what I have been working on in the laboratory. Thanks to OURS I was able to find and apply for a multitude of positions
                                        I would never have known about, and my applications were strong and well done because of the help I received from OURS. I am really looking forward to helping other students find research positions that will inspire
                                        and help them take advantage of the amazing opportunities UMass has to offer!<br></p>
